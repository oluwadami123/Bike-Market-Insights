# Bike-Market-Insights with Python 

## Project Overview 

The aim of this project is to uncover hidden pattern and trends of cutomers behaviour on the purchasing power of bikes based on Monthly inccome, Commute Distances, and lastly Age. All these factors boils down to why customers purchased bikes or not. The dataset was sourced from kaggle. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I performed a detailed and thorough exploratory data analysis, I successfully addressed key questions such as:
1. Determining the purchasing power of both genders.üßê
2. Analyzing the income distribution for male and female customers.
3. Identifying the age group with the highest purchasing power: Young Adults (25-29), Middle Age (30-49), or Old (50-89).ü§î
4. Evaluating the average commute distances for customers who purchased bikes.ü§î


## Result/ Findings 
1. Male customers had the highest purchasing power
2. The count for male customers with the highest income was more than female customers.
3. The target aga group with the highest purchasing power is the middle age group.
4. Cutomers with shorter commute distances purchased more bikes than those with shorter distances.
